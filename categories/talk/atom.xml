    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, Jacob and I participated in the <a href="http://softwarepassion.se/">Software Passion Conference</a> in Gothenburg. Heaps of fun! It was great to take part in a conference that wasn't all about the web, but programming in general. I find I tend to "stare into my navel" quite a bit, caring nothing about the world outside of JavaScript. So this was a great way to broaden my horizons!</p>


<p>Jacob held a lecture on <a href="http://kraniumjs.com/">Kranium</a>, his webifying framework for Titanium. If you want his slides, get in touch with him directly (twitterhandle @litenjacob), or wait for me to get him to post them here (but don't hold your breath).</p>


<p>I spoke on CoffeeScript, slides are right here:</p>

<p>All in all a great experience, thanx to all who turned up for our sessions! Special thanks to mr Crockford, who gave his blessing afterwards. I'll be smiling from ear to ear for weeks! :)</p>


<p>Hah... Jacob here. Here are my slides. Take that, brother! :-)</p>


<p>[[posterous-content:fxrsFkpiyGFAhCasibtr]]Unfortunately, the embedded videos are missing. However, you could have a look at a recording of my session at <a href="http://vimeo.com/30391192">CodeStrong</a>&nbsp;which is based on the same slides.</p>
