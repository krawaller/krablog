<h3>[[posterous-content:FBrEiFtnafqAquCkIAhw]]</h3>


<p>As your might have noticed, or cetainly soon will, this is unfortunately not a new post in the HTML5 vs Objective-C series. "Why not?" you say. Well, do not despair my friends, and let me first and foremost assure you there will be more posts. Heck, I've already coded the next project for the post-to-be (yes, it's pretty cool too, I dare say).</p>


<p>However, mighty men out there wanted otherwise. Well, no, they didn't really - I think they'd like it more than anyone else, but this is the result - me postponing the next post a week or so. I'm not sure how much I'll be able to tell you of all this, but what's certain is that I'll be going to the Mekka of web development and see what these brilliant men want from me :)</p>


<p>So please bear with me as I set out to follow the ways of the interwebz.</p>


<p>Cheers!</p>


<p>Jacob</p>
